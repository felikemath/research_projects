Learning is not confined to the classroom or individual coursework alone; it extends beyond them. Engaging in research and exploration, utilizing the amalgamation of computer science, AI, mathematics, physics, and various other fields, can be an incredibly enjoyable experience.

- [**Humpback Whale Identification task**: link to repo]({{"https://github.com/felikemath/projects-skeleton-code"}}). The goal of this project is to train a neural network model that accurately identifies species of whales given images of their tails. The challenge of this task is that there are over 5000 different classes of whale species, with little training images for each species. For this project, we are exploring the use of siamese networks instead of traditional CNN's for better performance.

- [**Reinforcement Learning Implementations**: link to repo]({{"https://github.com/felikemath/RL-Implementations/tree/master"}}). This project is an individual exploration of common reinforcement learning topics. There are hand written Python implementations of concepts such as policy iteration, value iteration, and montecarlo learning methods. Through these implementations, I hope to better understand reinforcement techniques used in modern practices.

- **UCLA App Project** (link will be available when made public). After noticing some issues with the current UCLA housing app, we have decided to make our own implementation of a more convenient campus wide application for students. The app aims to include all the information available on the current app (dining options, menus, bruincard balance), as well as more options that students can opt in to (personalized workout plan, information on more detailed dining hall activity, etc.). The app will be built primarily using React Native, featuring javascript libraries like tailwind and such.

- [**AI Project**: Mobile application of handwriting recognition based on deep learning neuro network.]({{"/project4.html" | relative_url }}) This project includes multiple tasks: <br/>

  - build 4 CNN-based neuro networks (namely the simple, intermediate I, intermediate II, and advanced networks) of different convolution kernels, different ways of doing down-sampling, with and without _BatchNorms_, _DropOut_, _Data Augmentation_, etc. techniques; <br/>
  - investigate their impact on the accuracy of recognition; <br/>
  - build a backend server using flask; <br/>
  - build a frontend application for both mobile and desktop versions. <br/><br/>

- [**Simulation / Game**: Multi-bouncing-ball game]({{"/project3.html" | relative_url }}). This game simulates collision between multiple moving balls of different size and mass, between the balls and walls, and between the balls and the bat.

- [**Earth-to-Mars Simulation**: Graphic animation of Earth-to-Mars spacecraft trajectory along the Hohmann transfer orbit, together with moves of Earth and Mars around the sun.]({{"/project2.html" | relative_url }}) Again, elapsed flight time, traveled distance, instantaneous speed, and instantaneous distances from the spacecraft to Earth, Mars and Sun are monitored through the animation.

- [**Projectile Simulation**: Graphic animation of projectile with and without air resistance.]({{"/project1.html" | relative_url }}) In addition to simulation of the motions, instantaneous real-time locations, velocities, mechanical energies and travel distances are also monitored through the animation.
