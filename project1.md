# Animation of Projectile Motion with and without Air Resistance 

## Project duration
June, 2021

## Introduction
Projectiles are very common in our daily life, such as throwing a water-balloon, shooting a basketball, shot put, etc. From my AP physics class, I learned that the motion of projectiles has a parabolic trajectory when air resistance is negligible, but we never explored the scenario containing air resistance. This project demonstrates the effect of air resistance on the motion of projectiles through the visualizations of 2-d projectiles in Python. Click here to jump to see the animation result.
## Objectives 
The objectives of this projects include
•	To animate the motion of projectiles with and without considering air resistance. 
•	To compute and compare instantaneous locations, velocities, travel distances and energies. 
## Methods
### 1.	Physics and Math
It is well known that air resistance depends on the speed, shape and size of projectiles, density of air, and some other factors. Therefore, it can be a complex phenomenon to study and measure. In this project, we simplify the model by assuming that the drag force of air resistance is proportional to the speed of the projectile and always opposite to the direction of its velocity
